Uhh so basically the first form is when the content is generated **statically**.
so like when you run `npm run build` or whatever, the server generateds all the html files and doesnt do shit after that

its like in this quote by enstien albert:

> static is cool

alright so the second form is when the server receives a request and then does some things to give some static html back to the client
this is called **server-side-rendering** (_SSR_ for short)
